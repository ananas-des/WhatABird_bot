Also it contains [Jupyter Notebook](./source/birds_model.ipynb) with ResNet-50 model training and [presentation](./What_A_Bird_Bot.pdf) with some descriptions. Follow the guidelines to set up and launch your Telegram Bot.

## Creating a Telegram Bot

[Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-using-python/) the instructions for creating automated chatbots.

1. Getting Bot token
- search for @botfather in Telegram;
- start a conversation with BotFather by clicking on the Start button;
- type `/newbot`, and follow the prompts to set up a new bot. The BotFather will give you a **token** that you will use to authenticate your bot and grant it access to the Telegram API.

**Note**: Make sure you *store the token securely*. Anyone with your token access can easily manipulate your bot.

2. Cloning repository and setting up an environment
- clone this repository using an **SSH** key

```git clone git@github.com:AnasZol/WhatABird_bot.git```

- navigate to local repository

```cd WhatABird_bot/```

- create and activate virtual environment with required packages using `conda`

```
conda create -n bird_bot --file requirements.txt
conda activate bird_bot
```

- navigate to `source` folder

```cd source/```

- open your favorite code editor and create a `.env` file to store your token generated by The BotFather for your bot authentification and access to the Telegram API. Paste the following into file

```export BOT_TOKEN=your-bot-token-here```

- read the environment variables from the `.env` file

```source .env```
